I.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Are</span> there any fish in the river to which you
are going?</p>


<div class='center'><br />II.</div>

<p>Having settled the above question in the
affirmative, get some person who knows the
water to show you whereabout the fish usually
lie; and when he shows them to you, do not
show yourself to them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />III.</div>

<p>Comparatively coarse fishing will succeed
better when you are not seen by the fish,
than the finest when they see you.</p>


<div class='center'><br />IV.</div>

<p>Do not imagine that, because a fish does
not instantly dart off on first seeing you, he
is the less aware of your presence; he almost
always on such occasions ceases to feed, and
pays you the compliment of devoting his
whole attention to you, whilst he is preparing
for a start whenever the apprehended danger
becomes sufficiently imminent.</p>


<div class='center'><br />V.</div>

<p>By wading when the sun does not shine,
you may walk in the river within eighteen or
twenty yards below a fish, which would be
immediately driven away by your walking on
the bank on either side, though at a greater
distance from him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />VI.</div>

<p>When you are fishing with the natural
May-fly, it is as well to wait for a passing
cloud, as to drive away the fish by putting
your fly to him in the glare of the sunshine,
when he will not take it.</p>


<div class='center'><br />VII.</div>

<p>If you pass your fly neatly and well three
times over a trout, and he refuses it, do not
wait any longer for him: you may be sure
that he has seen the line of invitation which
you have sent over the water to him, and
does not intend to come.</p>


<div class='center'><br />VIII.</div>

<p>If your line be nearly <i>taut</i>, as it ought
to be, with little or no gut in the water, a
good fish will always hook himself, on your
gently raising the top of the rod when he has
taken the fly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 433px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;Whence he is to be instantly whipt out by an expert <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'asssitant'">assistant</ins>, furnished,&quot; &amp;c.
</span>
<div class='ref'>To face page 6.</div>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX.</div>

<p>If you are above a fish in the stream when
you hook him, get below him as soon as you
can; and remember that if you pull him, but
for an instant, against the stream, he will, if
a heavy fish, break his hold; or if he should
be firmly hooked, you will probably find that
the united strength of the stream and fish is
too much for your skill and tackle.</p>


<div class='center'><br />X.</div>

<p>I do not think that a fish has much power
of stopping himself if, immediately on being
hooked, he is moved slowly with the current,
under the attractive influence of your rod
and line. He will soon find that a forced
march of this sort is very fatiguing, and he
may then be brought, by a well-regulated
exercise of gentle violence, to the bank, from
whence he is to be instantly whipt out by an
expert assistant, furnished with a landing-net,
the ring of which ought not to be of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
less diameter than eighteen inches, the handle
of it being seven feet long.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XI.</div>

<p>If, after hooking a trout, you allow him to
remain stationary but for a moment, he will
have time to put his helm hard a-port or
a-starboard, and to offer some resistance.
Strong tackle now becomes useful.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XII.</div>

<p>Bear always in mind that no tackle is
strong enough, unless well handled. A good
fisherman will easily kill a trout of three
pounds with a rod and a line which are not
strong enough to lift a dead weight of one
pound from the floor, and place it on the
table.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XIII.</div>

<p>Remember that, in whipping with the
artificial fly, it must have time, when you
have drawn it out of the water, to make the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
whole circuit, and to be at one time straight
behind you, before it can be driven out
straight before you. If you give it the forward
impulse too soon, you will hear a crack.
Take this as a hint that your fly is gone to
grass.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XIV.</div>

<p>Never throw with a long line when a short
one will answer your purpose. The most
difficult fish to hook is one which is rising at
three-fourths of the utmost distance to which
you can throw. Even when you are at the
extent of your distance, you have a better
chance; because in this case, when you do
reach him, your line will be straight, and,
when you do not, the intermediate failures
will not alarm him.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XV.</div>

<p>It appears to me that, in whipping with an
artificial fly, there are only two cases in which
a fish taking the fly will infallibly hook himself
without your assistance, viz.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>1. When your fly first touches the water
at the end of a straight line.</p>

<p>2. When you are drawing out your fly for
a new throw.</p>

<p>In all other cases it is necessary that, in
order to hook him when he has taken the
fly, you should do something with your wrist
which it is not easy to describe.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XVI.</div>

<p>If your line should fall loose and wavy
into the water, it will either frighten away
the fish, or he will take the fly into his mouth
without fastening himself; and when he finds
that it does not answer his purpose, he will
spit it out again, before it has answered yours.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XVII.</div>

<p>Although the question of fishing up or
down the stream is usually settled by the
direction of the wind, you may sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
have the option; and it is, therefore, as well
to say a word or two on both sides.</p>

<p>1. If, when you are fishing down-stream,
you take a step or two with each successive
throw, your fly is always travelling over new
water, which cannot have been disturbed by
the passing of your line.</p>


<div class='center'><br />2. When you are fishing up-stream, you
may lose the advantage of raising so many
fish; but, on the other hand, you will have
a better chance of hooking those which rise
at your fly, because the darting forward of a
fish seizing it has a tendency to tighten your
line, and produce the desired effect.</div>


<p>3. If you are in the habit of sometimes
catching a fish, there is another great advantage
in fishing up-stream, viz. whilst you
are playing and leading (necessarily down-stream)
the fish which you have hooked, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
do not alarm the others which are above you,
waiting till their turn comes.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XVIII.</div>

<p>The learned are much divided in opinion
as to the propriety of whipping with two
flies or with one. I am humbly of opinion
that your chance of hooking fish is much
increased by your using two flies; but I
think that, by using only one, you increase
your chance of landing the fish.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XIX.</div>

<p>When you are using two flies, you can
easily find the bob-fly on the top of the
water, and thus be sure that the end-fly is
not far off. When you are using only one
fly, you cannot so easily see where the fly is;
but I think that you can make a better guess
as to where the fish is likely to be after you
have hooked him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 439px;">
<img src="images/illus-019.png" width="439" height="500" alt="&quot;You will find it difficult, with all your attractions, to overcome the
strong attachment,&quot; &amp;c." title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;You will find it difficult, with all your attractions, to overcome the
strong attachment,&quot; &amp;c.</span>

<div class='ref'>To face page 12.</div>
</div>

<div class='center'><br />XX.</div>

<p>Also, when you are using two flies, you
may sometimes catch a fish with one of them,
and a weed growing in the river with the
other. When such a <i>liaison</i> is once formed,
you will find it difficult, with all your attractions,
to overcome the strong attachment of
the fish to your worthless rival the weed.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXI.</div>

<p>If the weed will not give way in the
awkward juncture above alluded to, you must
proceed to extremities. "Then comes the
tug of war;" and your line is quite as likely
to break between you and the fish, as between
the fish and the weed.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXII.</div>

<p>When, during the season of the May-fly,
your friends, the gentlemen from London,
say that they "have scarcely seen a fish rise
all day," do not too hastily conclude that the
fish have not been feeding on the fly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XXIII.</div>

<p>The only "rising" which is seen by the
unlearned is the splash which is made by a
fish when he darts from a considerable depth
in the water to catch an occasional fly on the
surface. There is, however, another sort of
"rising," which is better worth the skilful
angler's attention, viz.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXIV.</div>

<p>When a fish is seriously feeding on the
fly, he stations himself at no greater depth
than his own length, and, making his tail the
hinge of his motions, he gently raises his
mouth to the top of the water, and quietly
sucks in the fly attempting to pass over him.
A rising of this sort is not easily seen, but it
is worth looking for; because, although a
fish feeding in this manner will rarely go
many inches on either side for a fly, he will
as rarely refuse to take one which comes
(without any gut in the water) directly to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XXV.</div>

<p>If your fly (gut unfortunately included)
should swim over a fish without his taking it,
look out well for a darting line of undulation,
which betokens his immediate departure;
and remember, that it is of no use to continue
fishing for him after he is gone.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXVI.</div>

<p>The stations chosen by fish for feeding are
those which are likely to afford them good
sport in catching flies, viz.</p>

<p>1. The mouths of ditches running into the
river.</p>

<p>2. The confluence of two branches of a
stream, which has been divided by a patch
of weeds.</p>

<p>3. That part of a stream which has been
narrowed by two such patches.</p>

<p>4. Fish are also to be found under the
bank opposite to the wind, where they are
waiting for the flies which are blown against
that bank, and fall into the river.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XXVII.</div>

<p>If, during your walks by the river-side,
you have marked any good fish, it is fair to
presume that other persons have marked
them also. Suppose the case of two well-known
fish, one of them (which I will call A.)
lying above a certain bridge, the other (which
I will call B.) lying below the bridge. Suppose
further that you have just caught B.,
and that some curious and cunning friend
should say to you in a careless way, "Where
did you take that fine fish?" a finished fisherman
would advise you to tell your inquiring
friend that you had taken your fish just <i>above</i>
the bridge, describing, as the scene of action,
the spot which, in truth, you know to be still
occupied by the other fish, A. Your friend
would then fish no more for A., supposing
that to be the fish which you have caught;
and whilst he innocently resumes his operations
below the bridge, where he falsely imagines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
B. still to be, A. is left quietly for you,
if you can catch him.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXVIII.</div>

<p>When you see a large fish rising so greedily
in the middle of a sharp stream, that you
feel almost sure of his instantly taking your
May-fly, I would advise you to make an accurate
survey of all obstructions in the immediate
neighbourhood of your feet&mdash;of any
ditch which may be close behind you&mdash;or of
any narrow plank, amidst high rushes, which
you may shortly have to walk over in a hurry.
If you should hook the fish, a knowledge of
these interesting localities will be very useful
to you.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXIX.</div>

<p>When your water-proof boots are wet
through, make a hole or two near the bottom
of them, in order that the water, which runs
in whilst you are walking in the river, may
run freely out again whilst you are walking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
on the bank. You will thus avoid an accompaniment
of pumping-music, which is not
agreeable.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXX.</div>

<p>Never mind what they of the old school
say about "playing him till he is tired."
Much valuable time and many a good fish
may be lost by this antiquated proceeding.
Put him into your basket <i>as soon as you can</i>.
Everything depends on the manner in which
you commence your acquaintance with him.
If you can at first prevail upon him to go
a little way down the stream with you, you
will have no difficulty afterwards in persuading
him to let you have the pleasure of
seeing him at dinner.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXI.</div>

<p>Do not be afraid of filling your pockets too
full when you go out; you are more likely
to leave something behind you than to take
too much. A man who seldom catches a fish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
at any other time, usually gets hold of one
(and loses him of course) whilst his attendant
is gone back for something which had been
forgotten.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXII.</div>

<p>If your attendant is a handy fellow at
landing a fish, let him do it in his own way:
if he is not, try to find a better man, or go
home. Although so much depends upon his
skill, you will rarely derive much comfort
from asking him for his opinion. If you
have had bad sport, and say to him, "Which
way shall we go now?" he will most probably
say, "Where you please, sir." If you ask
him what he thinks of the weather, he is
very likely to say that last week (<i>when you
were in London</i>) it was "famous weather for
fishing;" or he will perhaps say, that he expects
that next week (<i>when you are to be at
home again</i>) it will be very good. I never
knew one of these men who was satisfied
with the present hour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXIII.</div>

<p>Do not leave off fishing early in the evening
because your friends are tired. After a
bright day, the largest fish are to be caught
by whipping between sunset and dark. Even,
however, in these precious moments, you will
not have good sport if you continue throwing
after you have whipped your fly off. Pay
attention to this; and if you have any doubt
after dusk, you may easily ascertain the point,
by drawing the end of the line quickly
through your hand,&mdash;particularly if you do
not wear gloves.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXIV.</div>

<p>No attempt is here made to give directions
as to the best seasons for cutting the woods
which are fittest for the making of rods, or
as to the mode of preparing them; because
the worst rod which is kept for sale at the
present day is probably as good as the best
of the first few dozen which any amateur is
likely to make for himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXV.</div>

<p>Lastly&mdash;When you have got hold of a good
fish, which is not very tractable, if you are
married, gentle reader, think of your wife,
who, like the fish, is united to you by very
tender ties, which can only end with her
death, or her going into weeds. If you are
single, the loss of the fish, when you thought
the prize your own, may remind you of some
more serious disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I forgot</span> to say, that, if a friend should
invite you to his house, saying that he will
give you "an excellent day's fishing," you
ought not to doubt his kind intention, but
you certainly ought not to feel very sure that
you will have good sport. Provide yourself
for such a visit with everything which you
may want, as if you were going into an uninhabited
country. Above all things, take a
landing-net with you. Your friend's (if he
has one) is probably torn and without a
handle, being a sort of reticulated shovel for
taking fish out of the well of a punt. Take
warning from the following story:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson and Mr. Thompson went last
week to the house of Mr. Jenkins, for a few
days' fishing. They were received with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
utmost kindness and hospitality by Mr. and
Mrs. Jenkins, and on the following morning
after breakfast, the gardener (who was on
that day called the fisherman) was desired to
attend them to the river. Thompson, who
had a landing-net of his own, begged to have
a boy to carry it. Jack was immediately
sent for, and he appeared in <i>top</i> boots, with
a livery hat and waistcoat.</p>

<p>Arrived at the water-side, Thompson gave
his gnat-basket to the boy, and told him to
go on the other side of the river, and look on
the grass for a few May-flies. Jack said
that he did not exactly know what May-flies
were, and that the river could not be crossed
without going over a bridge a mile off.
Thompson is a patient man, so he began to
fish with his landing-net for a few May-flies,
and after he had necessarily frightened away
many fish, he succeeded in catching six or
seven May-flies.</p>



<p>Working one of them with the blowing-line<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
much to his own satisfaction, and thinking
to extract a compliment from his attendant,
he said, "They do not often fish here
in this way&mdash;do they?" "No," said the boy,
"they drags wi' a net; they did zo the day
afore yesterday."</p>

<p>Our angler, after much patient fishing,
hooked a fine trout; and having brought him
carefully to the bank, he said, "Now, my
lad, don't be in a hurry, but get him out as
soon as you can." Jack ran to the water's
edge, threw down the net, and seizing the
line with both hands, of course broke it immediately.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, Thompson now mended
his tackle and went on fishing; and when he
thought, "good easy man," that the very
moment for hooking another trout was arrived,
there was a great splash just above his
fly;&mdash;and the boy exclaiming, "Damn un,
I miss'd un," instantly threw a second brick-bat
at a rat which was crossing the river.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Mine host, in order to accommodate his
friends, dined early; and when they went
after dinner to enjoy the evening fishing,
they found that the miller had turned off the
water, and that the river was nearly dry,&mdash;so
they went back to tea.</p>

<div class='center'>I.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Making</span> a great improvement in a receipt
which a friend had given you for staining
gut&mdash;and finding that you have produced
exactly the colour which you wanted, but
that the dye has made all your bottoms quite
rotten.</p>


<div class='center'><br />II.</div>

<p>Suddenly putting up your hand to save
your hat in a high wind, and grasping a
number of artificial flies, which you had
pinned round it, without any intention of
taking hold of more than one at a time.</p>

<div class='center'><br />III.</div>

<p>Leading a large fish down-stream and
arriving at a ditch, the width of which is
evident, although the depth of it may be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
matter of some doubt. Having thus to decide
very quickly whether you will lose the
fish and half your tackle, or run the risk of
going up to your neck in mud. Perhaps
both.</p>


<div class='center'><br />IV.</div>

<p>Feeling rather unsteady whilst you are
walking on a windy day over an old foot-bridge,
and having occasion to regret the
decayed state of the hand-rail, which once
protected the passing fisherman.</p>


<div class='center'><br />V.</div>

<p>Fishing for the first time with flies of your
own making&mdash;and finding that they are quite
as good as any which you can buy, except
that the hooks are not so firmly tied to the
gut.</p>


<div class='center'><br />VI.</div>

<p>Taking out with you as your aide-de-camp
an unsophisticated lad from the neighbouring
village, who laughs at you when you miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
hooking a fish rising at a fly, and says with
a grin. "You can't vasten 'em as my vather
does."</p>




<div class='center'><br />VII.</div>

<p>Making the very throw which you feel
sure will at last enable you to reach a fish
that is rising at some distance&mdash;and seeing
the upper half of your rod go into the middle
of the river. When you have towed it
ashore, finding that it has broken off close to
the ferule, which is immoveably fixed in the
lower half of your rod.</p>


<div class='center'><br />VIII.</div>

<p>Feeling the first cold drop giving notice
to your great toe that in less than two minutes
your boot will be full of water.</p>


<div class='center'><br />IX.</div>

<p>Going out on a morning so fine that no
man would think of taking his water-proof
cloak with him&mdash;and then, before catching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
any fish, being thoroughly wet through by an
unexpected shower.</p>


<div class='center'><br />X.</div>

<p>When you cannot catch any fish&mdash;being
told by your attendant of the excellent sport
which your predecessor had on the same spot,
only a few days before.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XI.</div>

<p>Having brought with you from town a
large assortment of expensive artificial flies&mdash;and
being told on showing them to an experienced
native, that "They are certainly very
beautiful, but that none of them are of any
use here."</p>


<div class='center'><br />XII.</div>

<p>After trying in vain to reach a trout which
is rising on the opposite side of the river&mdash;at
last walking on; and before you have
gone 100 yards, looking back, and seeing
a more skilful friend catch him at the first
throw.&mdash;Weight 3 lbs. 2 oz.</p>

<div class='center'><br />XIII.</div>

<p>Having stupidly trodden on the top of
your rod&mdash;and then finding that the spare
top, which you have brought out with you in
the butt, belongs to the rod which you have
left at home, and will not fit that which you
are using.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XIV.</div>

<p>Having steered safely through some very
dangerous weeds a fish which you consider
to weigh at least 3 lbs., and having brought
him safely to the very edge of the bank,&mdash;then
seeing him, when he is all but in the landing-net,
make a plunge, which in a moment renders
all your previous skill of no avail, and
puts it out of your power to verify the accuracy
of your calculations as to his weight.</p>



<div class='center'><br />XV.</div>

<p>Fishing with the blowing-line when the
wind is so light that your fly is seldom more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
than two yards from you, or when the wind
is so strong that it always carries your fly up
into the air, before it comes to the spot which
you wish it to swim over.</p>

</div>
<div class='center'><br />XVI.</div>

<p>Wishing to show off before a young friend
whom you have been learnedly instructing in
the mysteries of the art, and finding that you
cannot catch any fish yourself, whilst he (an
inexperienced hand) hooks and lands (by
mere accident of course) a very large one.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XVII.</div>

<p>Attempting to walk across the river in a
new place without knowing exactly whereabouts
certain holes, which you have heard
of, are. Probing the bottom in front of you
with the handle of your landing-net,&mdash;and
finding it very soft.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XVIII.</div>

<p>Going some distance for three days' fishing,
on the two first of which there is bright sunshine
and no wind, and then finding that the
third, which opens with "a southerly wind
and a cloudy sky," is the day which a neighbouring
farmer has fixed upon for washing
two hundred sheep on the shallow where you
expected to have the best sport.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XIX.</div>

<p>Being allowed to have one day's fishing in
a stream, the windings of which are so many,
that it would require half a dozen different
winds to enable you to fish the greater part
of it, from the only side to which your leave
extends.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XX.</div>

<p>Finding, on taking your book out of your
pocket, that the fly at the end of your line is
not the only one by many dozen which you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
have had in the water, whilst you have been
wading rather too deep.</p>

</span>
<div class='ref'>To face page 34.</div>
</div>
<div class='center'><br />XXI.</div>

<p>Wading half an inch deeper than the tops
of your boots, and finding afterwards that
you must carry about with you four or five
quarts in each, or must sit down on the wet
grass whilst your attendant pulls them off, in
order that you may empty them, and try to
pull them on again.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXII.</div>

<p>Jumping out of bed very early every morning,
during the season of the May-fly, to look
at a weathercock opposite to your window,
and always finding the wind either in the
north or east.</p>




<div class='center'><br />XXIII.</div>

<p>Having just hooked a heavy fish, when you
are using the blowing-line, and seeing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
silk break about two feet above your hand;
then watching the broken end as it travels
quickly through each successive ring, till it
finally leaves the top of your rod, and follows
the fish to the bottom of the river.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXIV.</div>

<p>Receiving a very elegant new rod from
London, and being told by one of the most
skilful of your brother anglers, that it is so
stiff,&mdash;and by another, that it is so pliant, that
it is not possible for any man to throw a
fly properly with it.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXV.</div>

<p>Being obliged to listen to a long story
about the difficulties which one of your
friends had to encounter in landing a very
fine trout which has just been placed on the
table for dinner, when you have no story of
the same sort to tell in return.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'><br />XXVI.</div>

<p>Hooking a large trout, and then turning
the handle of your reel the wrong way; thus
producing an effect diametrically opposite to
that of shortening your line, and making the
fish more unmanageable than before.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXVII.</div>

<p>Arriving just before sunset at a shallow,
where the fish are rising beautifully, and
finding that they are all about to be immediately
driven away by five-and-twenty cows,
which are preparing to walk very leisurely
across the river in open files.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXVIII.</div>

<p>Coming to an ugly ditch in your way
across a water-meadow late in the day, when
you are too tired to jump, and being obliged
to walk half a mile in search of a place where
you think you can step over it.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XXIX.</div>

<p>Flattering yourself that you had brought
home the largest fish of the day, and then
finding that two of your party have each of
them caught a trout more than half a pound
heavier than <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'your's'">yours</ins>.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXX.</div>

<p>Finding yourself reduced to the necessity
of talking about the beautiful form and colour
of some trout, which you have caught, being
well aware that in the important particular of
<i>weight</i>, they are much inferior to several of
those taken on the same day by one of your
companions.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXI.</div>

<p>Telling a long story after dinner, tending
to show (with full particulars of time and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
place) how that, under very difficult circumstances,
and notwithstanding very great skill
on your part, your tackle had been that
morning broken and carried away by a very
large fish; and then having the identical fly,
lost by you on that occasion, returned to you
by one of your party, who found it in the
mouth of a trout, caught by him, about an hour
after your disaster, on the very spot so accurately
described by you&mdash;the said very large
fish being, after all, a very small one.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXII.</div>

<p>Arriving at a friend's house in the country,
one very cold evening in March, and being
told by his keeper that there are a great many
large pike in the water, and that you are sure
of having good sport on the following day;
and then looking out of your bed-room
window the next morning, and seeing two unhappy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
swans dancing an awkward sort of
minuet on the ice, the surface of the lake
having been completely frozen during the
night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a subsequent occasion our honest anglers
repeated their visit to Mr. Jenkins, who, with
the view of making himself more agreeable
to his guests, had, in the meantime, agreed to
pay an annual rent to the miller, for the exclusive
right of fishing in some water belonging
to the mill, which was said to contain the
largest fish in the river.</p>

<p>Now, this miller had a son, who, whilst he
followed his father's daily occupation of preparing
matter for the <i>loaves</i>, sometimes thought
of the <i>fishes</i> too; and he was better known in
the neighbourhood for his great skill in fishing,
than for any unusual acquaintance with the
mysteries of grinding. He had frequently
used much argument and entreaty to dissuade
his father from letting the fishery; but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
prudent old miller thought that &pound;15 per
annum, to be paid by Mr. Jenkins, would be
more profitable to him, than any pleasure
which his son might derive from catching
many fine brace of trout during the season.</p>

<div class='ref'>To face page 43.</div>
</div>

<p>Such was the state of affairs in this part
of the world, when Mr. Jackson and Mr.
Thompson arrived early one morning, by
special invitation, to make a first trial of their
skill in the new water. The usual conversation
about the state of the weather was
quickly despatched at breakfast. The wind
was, for once, pronounced to be in the right
quarter. It was unanimously agreed that there
could not well be a more favourable day for
fishing, and that, therefore, the gentlemen
ought to lose no time in going down to the
river. Our old friend, Thompson, who, as we
have already seen, was not always very successful
with a fly, had lately, in order that he
might have two strings to his bow<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>, been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
learning another branch of the gentle art,
called "Spinning a minnow;" and he now
sallied forth, not "equal to both," but "armed
for either field," and walked with a confident
step to a celebrated spot below the mill. This
new acquirement had been kept a profound
secret from Jackson, who went out, as usual,
fly-fishing, and proceeded to a part of the
stream above the mill.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that the young
miller would work cheerfully at the mill that
morning. He felt that, although he had been
cruelly deprived of the fishery by his father,
he surely had a right to <i>look</i> at the gentlemen
if he pleased; he therefore put on his
dusty hat and walked, in a surly mood, to the
river side,&mdash;taking with him, as the companion
of his sorrows, a ragged little boy, who
had often witnessed his exploits with envy
and admiration, and occasionally imitated his
great example in a very humble manner by
fishing for gudgeons in the canal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The youth and the boy found Thompson
so busily engaged in arranging his new
spinning-tackle, that he did not perceive that
they had established themselves within a few
yards of him. There he stood upon the bank,
deeply impressed with the value of some
excellent instructions which he had lately
received for his guidance, and fully sensible
of the vast superiority over Jackson which he
now possessed. Having at last settled every
preliminary to his entire satisfaction, he was
just about to cast in his minnow for the first
time, when the miller attracted Thompson's
notice by that peculiar sort of short cough
which is a relief to suppressed insolence, and
acts as a safety-valve to prevent explosion.</p>

<p>Poor Thompson! He did not feel quite
qualified for a performance of the kind
before a critic so well able to judge, and so
little disposed to admire; but he considered
that it would be <i>infra dig.</i> to appear disconcerted
by the young miller's presence,&mdash;so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
he assumed a look of defiance, and manfully
commenced operations.</p>

<p>After one or two bad throws, and sundry
awkward attempts at improvement, a fine
trout (<i>mirabile dictu!</i>) darted from under
the bank and seized his minnow. "Who cares
for the miller now?" thought Thompson;
but, alas! the happy thought passed through
his mind&mdash;</p>

<p>Long before Thompson had recovered
from the effects of this sad disaster, Jenkins
came up to him to announce that luncheon
was ready. Overwhelming our poor sufferer
with a torrent of well-meant condolence, he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Thompson!</p>

<p>"What! no sport?</p>

<p>"That <i>is</i> unlucky!</p>

<p>"I am very anxious that <i>you</i> should catch
a good fish. <i>Jackson</i> has just caught a
brace of very fine ones!</p>

<p>"This is exactly the spot where I expected
that you would have the best sport!</p>



<p>"The miller tells me that the largest fish
lie there<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>, near that broken post under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
opposite bank. Pray cast your minnow close
to that, and you will be sure to run a fish
almost immediately."</p>

<p>Jenkins little knew what he was asking.
The aforesaid post was at a formidable distance,&mdash;it
could only be reached by a most
skilful hand. Thompson felt by no means
disposed to attempt it, because, although
Jenkins appeared to think that it would be
an easy task for so finished an angler as
Thompson, he himself had no doubt that the
odious miller, who was still looking on, was
of a very different opinion. He therefore
thought that it would be wise to leave the
question undetermined, and not to give a
<i>casting</i> vote on the occasion.</p>

<p>And now Thompson, turning his back on
the river, walked home arm-in-arm with his
friend Mr. Jenkins, grieving much about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
fish which he had lost, and perhaps a little
about those which Jackson had caught.</p>

<p>The brace of very fine trout, said to have
been caught by Mr. Jackson, were exhibited
by him in due form to Mr. Thompson and
the ladies, just before luncheon. Whilst
he was pointing out the beautiful condition
of the fish, without at all underrating their
weight, Miss Smith, who was staying on a
visit with her sister, Mrs. Jenkins, pleasantly
remarked that Mr. Jackson was very <i>lucky</i>
to have caught two such fine fish whilst Mr.
Thompson had not caught any. This led to
an interesting conversation about the caprice
of the fickle goddess, so often alluded to in
the lamentations of an unsuccessful angler.
Thompson took no part in the discussion, and
he did not refer them to the miller or the
little boy for any other explanation<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
cause of his failure; but he begged that they
would allow him to eat his luncheon, without
waiting for the rest of the party, as he was
anxious to return as soon as possible to the
river, where he expected to have great sport
in the evening.</p>

<p>After luncheon, our unfortunate hero did
not catch any fish, and he found that he could
not throw his minnow within several yards
of the far-famed post, even when he was not
annoyed by spectators. He contrived, however,
to get fast hold of another, at a much
less distance from him; in consequence of
which, he was obliged to abandon a second
set of his best minnow tackle (price 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>)
to its fate in the middle of the river.</p>

<p>At the end of <i>his day's sport</i>, Thompson
omitted to use the wise precaution of taking
his rod to pieces<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>, before leaving the river
side. On his way homewards, in the evening,
he met the little boy, who slily asked him if
he had had good sport <i>since</i>. This brought to
his recollection the fact of his having to pass
through the mill, in order to cross the river;
and the prospect of his being asked a similar
question by the miller was not agreeable.
When he arrived at the mill, all was quiet; and
he, therefore, flattered himself that the miller
was comfortably enjoying his pipe at the ale-house.&mdash;Thompson
was now so elated at the
idea of passing through unobserved, that he
quite forgot the exalted state of his rod, until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
he was reminded of it by a sudden jerk which
broke off the top, leaving his third and last set
of tackle, with a brilliant artificial minnow,
sticking fast in a projecting rafter<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> above
his reach. Hastily shoving the broken joint
(Thompson never swears) into the butt of
his rod, he hoped that he should be able to
conceal all knowledge of this last misfortune.
He, however, felt very unwilling that the
shining little minnow should remain in its
present position, as a glaring proof of his
awkwardness; and it immediately occurred to
him, that a small ladder, which was close at
hand, was a thing exactly suited to the occasion;
but at the very moment when he became
convinced, by actual experiment, that it
was too short for his purpose, his ears were
assailed by a loud repetition of the cruel
cough, and his eyes were met by a killing
glance from those of the miller's son.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p><p>On the following day, Thompson returned,
much out of spirits, to London. On that day,
too, the young miller resumed his duties at
the mill, less out of humour than before.
Very shortly after this the old miller died,
and the son then took the fishery into his
own hands; and, however closely he may
now resemble his late grandfather (who formerly
lived on the River Dee), in caring for
nobody, he never, whilst Thompson lives, will
be able to say "Nobody cares for me."</p>

<p>"So ends my Tale:" for I fear that the
reader must think that, like Thompson, he
has now had quite enough of "<span class="smcap">The Miseries
of Fishing</span>." I feel, however, assured
that he will forgive me for relating this story,
because, although his attention may be fatigued
by the perusal of it, his eye will be
gratified by the beauty of several new illustrations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>

</div>


<div class='center'><br />I.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Win</span> as often as you can, but never make
any display of insulting joy on the occasion.
When you cannot win&mdash;lose (though you may
not like it) with good temper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />II.</div>

<p>If your adversary, after you have won a
game, wishes to prove that you have done so
in consequence of some fault of his rather
than by your own good play, you need not
enter into much argument on the subject,
whilst he is explaining to the by-standers the
mode by which he might have won the game,
<i>but did not</i>.</p>


<div class='center'><br />III.</div>

<p>Nor need you make yourself uneasy if your
adversary should console himself by pointing
out a mode by which you might have won
the game in a shorter and more masterly
manner. Listen patiently to his explanation&mdash;it
cannot prove that your way was not good
enough. <i>Tous les chemins sont bons qui
m&eacute;nent &agrave; la victoire.</i></p>


<div class='center'><br />IV.</div>

<p>When you are playing with an opponent
whom you feel sure that you can master, do
not insult him by saying that you consider<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
him a stronger player than yourself,&mdash;but that
perhaps particular circumstances may prevent
him from playing with his usual force
to-day, &amp;c. &amp;c. Men usually play as well as
they can: they are glad when they win, and
sorry when they lose.</p>


<div class='center'><br />V.</div>

<p>Sometimes&mdash;when, alas! you have lost the
game&mdash;an unmerciful conqueror will insist on
"murdering Pizarro all over again," and
glories in explaining how that your game was
irretrievable after you had given a certain
injudicious check with the queen,<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> (the consequence
of which <i>he says</i> that he immediately
foresaw,) and that then, by a succession of
very good moves on his part, he won easily.
You must bear all this as well as you can,
although it is certainly not fair to "preach'ee
and flog'ee too."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>VI.</p>

<p>A good player seldom complains that another
is slow. He is glad to have the opportunity
thus afforded to him of attentively considering
the state of the game. Do not,
therefore, be impatient when it is your adversary's
turn to move. Take as much time as
you require (<i>and no more</i>) when it is your
own turn.</p>


<div class='center'><br />VII.</div>

<p>If, whilst you are playing, your adversary
will talk about the state of the game, it is
very provoking, but you cannot help it, and
the pieces will give you ample revenge, if
you can avail yourself of their power.</p>


<div class='center'><br />VIII.</div>

<p>If the by-standers talk, it is still more
annoying: they always claim the merit of
having foreseen every good move which is
made, and they sometimes express great surprise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
at your not making a particular move;
which, if you had made it, would probably
have led to your speedily losing the game&mdash;before
which time they would have walked
away to another table.</p>


<div class='center'><br />IX.</div>

<p>Almost every moderate player thinks himself
fully qualified to criticise the move by
which a game has been lost.&mdash;Although, if
he had himself been in the loser's place, he
would, very probably, have been check-mated
twenty moves sooner than the opportunity occurred
for committing the particular mistake,
which he thinks he should have avoided.</p>


<div class='center'><br />X.</div>

<p>Amongst good players, it is considered to
be as much an indispensable condition of the
game, that a piece once touched must be
moved, as that the queen is not allowed to
have the knight's, or a rook the bishop's
move.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XI.</div>

<p>Some persons, when they are playing with
a stranger who entreats to be allowed to take
back a move, let him do so the first time:
then, almost immediately afterwards, they put
their own queen <i>en prise</i>; and when the
mistake is politely pointed out to them, they
say that <i>they</i> never take back a move, but
that they are ready to begin another game.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XII.</div>

<p>Do not be alarmed about the state of your
adversary's health, when, after losing two
or three games, he complains of having a bad
head-ache, or of feeling very unwell. If he
should win the next game, you will probably
hear no more of this.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XIII.</div>

<p>Never (if you can avoid it) lose a game to
a person who rarely wins when he plays with
you. If you do so, you may afterwards find
that this one game has been talked of to all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
his friends, although he may have forgotten
to mention ninety-nine others which had a
different result. Chess players have a very
retentive memory with regard to the games
which they win.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XIV.</div>

<p>If, therefore, any one should tell you that
on a certain day last week he won a game
from one of your friends, it may be as well
to ask how many other games were played on
the same day.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XV.</div>

<p>There is no better way of deciding on the
comparative skill of two players than by the
result of a number of games. Be satisfied
with that result, and do not attempt to reason
upon it.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XVI.</div>

<p>Remember the Italian proverb, "Never
make a good move without first looking out
for a better." Even if your adversary should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
leave his queen <i>en prise</i>, do not snap hastily
at it. The queen is a good thing to win,
but the game is a better.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XVII.</div>

<p>Between even, and tolerably good, players
a mere trifle frequently decides the event of
a game; but when you have gained a small
advantage, you must be satisfied with it for
the time. Do not, by attempting too much,
lose that which you have gained. Your object
should be to win the game, and the dullest
way of winning is better for you than the
most brilliant of losing.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XVIII.</div>

<p>If your knowledge of "the books" enables
you to see that a person, with whom you are
playing for the first time, opens his game
badly, do not suppose, as a matter of course,
that you are going to check-mate him in ten
or twelve moves. Many moves called <i>very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
bad</i> are only such if well opposed; and you
can derive but little advantage from them
unless you are well acquainted with the system
of crowding your adversary,&mdash;one of the
most difficult parts of the game.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XIX.</div>

<p>Some players have by study acquired
mechanically the art of opening their game
in a style much above their real force; but
when they have exhausted their store of
<i>book-knowledge</i>, they soon fall all to pieces,
and become an easy prey to those who have
genuine talent for the game. Others do not
know how to open their game on scientific
principles, and yet, if they can stagger through
the beginning without decided loss, fight
most nobly when there are but few pieces
and pawns left on the board. All these
varieties of play must be carefully studied by
those who wish to win. It is only talent for
the game, combined with much study and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
great practice, which can make a truly good
player.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XX.</div>

<p>Although no degree of instruction derived
from "books" will make a good player,
without much practice with all sorts of opponents,
yet, on the other hand, when you hear
a person, who has had great practice, boast
of never having looked into a chess-book,
you may be sure either that he is a bad
player, or that he is not nearly so good a
player as he might become by attentively
studying the laborious works which have
been published on almost every conceivable
opening, by such players as Ercole del Rio,
Ponziani, Philidor, Sarratt, and Lewis.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXI.</div>

<p>Between fine players, small odds (viz.
pawn, with one, or with two moves) are of
great consequence. Between inferior players<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
they are of none. The value of these odds
consists chiefly in position; and in every
long game between weak players, such an
advantage is gained and lost several times,
without either party being aware of it.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXII.</div>

<p>Almost all good players (<i>and some others</i>)
have a much higher opinion of their own
strength than it really deserves. One person
feels sure that he is a better player than
some particular opponent, although he cannot
but confess that, for some unaccountable
reason, or other, he does not always win a
majority of games from him. Another attributes
his failure solely to want of attention
to details which he considers hardly to involve
any real genius for the game; and he is
obliged to content himself with boasting of
having certainly, at one time, had much the
best of a game, which he afterwards lost,
<i>only by a mistake</i>. A third thinks that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
must be a good player, because he has discovered
almost all the many difficult check-mates
which have been published as problems.
He may be able to do this, and yet
be unable to play a whole game well, it being
much more easy to find out, at your leisure,
the way to do that which you are told beforehand
is practicable, than to decide, in actual
play, whether, or not, it is prudent to make
the attempt.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXIII.</div>

<p>A theoretical amateur, with much real
genius for the game, is often beaten by a
fourth-rate player at a chess club, who has
become from constant practice thoroughly
acquainted with all the technicalities of it,
and quietly builds up a wall for the other
to run his head against. The loser in this
case may <i>perhaps</i> eventually become the
better player of the two; but he is not so at
present.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XXIV.</div>

<p>A person sometimes tells you that he played
the other day, for the first time, with Mr.
Such-a-one, (a very celebrated player,) who
won the game, with great difficulty, after a
very hard fight. Your friend probably deceives
himself greatly in supposing this to be
the case. A player who has a reputation to
lose, always plays very cautiously against a
person whose strength he does not yet know:
he runs no risks, and does not attempt to do
more than win the game, which is all that he
undertook to do.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXV.</div>

<p>When you receive the odds of a piece from
a better player than yourself, remember he
sees everything which you see, and probably
much more. Be very careful how you attack
him. You must act in the early part of the
game entirely on the defensive, or probably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
you will not live long enough to enjoy the
advantage which has been given you. Even
though you may still have the advantage of
a piece more, when the game is far advanced,
you must not feel too sure of victory. Take
all his pawns quietly, <i>if you can</i>, and see
your way clearly before you attempt to check-mate
him. You will thus perhaps be longer
about it, but winning is very agreeable work.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXVI.</div>

<p>Many persons advise you, when you receive
the odds of a rook, <i>always</i> to make
exchanges as often as you can, in order to
maintain the numerical superiority with which
you began. This is very cunning; but you
will probably find that "<i>Master is Yorkshire
too</i>," and that he will not allow you to
make exchanges early in the game, except
under circumstances which lead you into a
ruinous inferiority of position.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XXVII.</div>

<p>You will never improve by playing only
with players of your own strength. In order
to play well, you must toil through the humiliating
task of being frequently beaten by
those who can give you odds. These odds,
when you have fairly mastered them, may be
gradually diminished as your strength increases.
Do not, however, deceive yourself
by imagining, that if you cannot win from
one of the <i>great players</i> when he gives you
the odds of a rook, you would stand a better
chance with the odds of a knight. This is a
very common error. It is true that, when a
knight is given, the attack made upon you is
not so sudden and so violent, as it usually is
when you receive a rook&mdash;but your ultimate
defeat is much more certain. If, in the one
case, you are quickly killed, in the other
you will die in lingering torments.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XXVIII.</div>

<p>When you hear of a man from the country,
who has beaten every body whom he has
ever played with, do not suppose, as a matter
of course, that he is a truly good player. He
may be only a "Triton of the Minnows."
All his fame depends upon the skill of the
parties with whom he has hitherto contended;
and provincial Philidors seldom prove to be
very good players, when their strength is
fairly measured at the London Chess Club,
particularly such of them as come there with
the reputation of having never been beaten.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXIX.</div>

<p>An elderly gentleman, lately returned from
India, is apt to suppose that his skill has
been much impaired by the change of climate,
or some other cause, when he finds, to his
great surprise, that his style of play does not
produce such an alarming effect in the Chess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Clubs of London or Paris, as it used to do at
Rumbarabad.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXX.</div>

<p>When you can decidedly win, at the odds
of a rook given by a first-rate player, you
will rank among the chosen few. It would
be very difficult to name twenty-five persons
in London to whom Mr. Lewis could not
fairly give these odds, although there are
many hundreds who would be much offended
at its being supposed to be possible that any
one could give them a knight.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXI.</div>

<p>A first-rate player, who is to give large
odds to a stranger, derives great advantage
from seeing him first play a game, or two,
with other persons. His style of play is
thus shown, and the class of risks which may
be ventured on is nicely calculated. That
which, before, might have been difficult, thus
becomes comparatively easy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXII.</div>

<p>There is as much difference between playing
a game well, by correspondence, and
playing one well over the board, as there is
between writing a good essay, and making a
good speech.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXIII.</div>

<p>No advantages of person and voice will
enable a man to become a good orator if he
does not understand the grammatical construction
of the language in which he speaks:
nor will the highest degree of ingenuity make
any man a good chess player, unless his preparations
for the exercise of that ingenuity
are made upon the soundest principles of the
game.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXIV.</div>

<p>Every game perfectly played throughout
on both sides would be by its nature drawn.
Since, then, in matches between the most celebrated
players and clubs of the day some of
the games have been won and lost, it seems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to follow that there <i>might</i> be better players
than have been hitherto known to exist.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXV.</div>

<p>Most of the persons who occasionally "play
at Chess" know little more than the moves
and a few of the general rules of the game.
Of those who have had more practice, some
have acquired a partial insight into the endless
variety of the combinations which may
be formed, and their beautiful intricacy:&mdash;a
few play moderately well; but, however small
the number of good players may be, it would
be difficult to find any one who, after having
played a few hundred games, would not
think it an imputation on his good sense to
be considered a very bad player;&mdash;and this is
the universal feeling, although it is well
known that men of the highest attainments
have studied Chess without great success;
and that the most celebrated players have not
always been men of distinguished talents.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXVI.</div>

<p>He who after much practice with fine
players remains for a long time without taking
his station amongst them, will find at last that
there is a point which he cannot pass. He
is obliged to confess his incurable inferiority
to players of the higher order, and he must be
content with easy victories over a large majority
of those whom he meets with in society.</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />CONCLUSION.</div>

<p>Chess holds forth to the philosopher relaxation
from his severer studies,&mdash;to the disappointed
man, relief from unavailing regret,&mdash;and
to the rich and idle, an inexhaustible
source of amusement and occupation. It has,
however, been frequently urged as an objection
to the study of the game, that no man can
pursue it, with a fair prospect of becoming
a good player, without devoting to it much
time and attention which might be more
beneficially employed.</p>

<p>Although it may perhaps be true in the
abstract, that even a high degree of skill is
not <i>per se</i> worth the time and trouble which
it must have cost, it should be remembered
that on this "mimic stage" of life much
besides chess may be seen and studied with
advantage. The real character of a man's
mind may, almost always, be known by his
behaviour under the varying circumstances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of this most interesting game. The triumph
of the winner, and the vexation of the loser,
are often coarsely displayed amongst inferior
players; and, although good players very
rarely give way to this degrading weakness,
still, the good breeding of some of them,
towards the end of a difficult match, is not
always quite perfect.</p>

<p>The temper of the student cannot fail to
derive very material benefit from the severe
discipline to which it will be subjected.
When he begins to play well he will find that
he has learnt to submit patiently to contradiction;
and that he has become convinced of
the necessity of abandoning his most favourite
schemes, whenever he sees that from
a change of circumstances they can be no
longer pursued with safety.&mdash;He will have
felt the full value of using caution and circumspection,
when called upon to exercise his
judgment in cases of complicated difficulty,
and he will have acquired the faculty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
fixing his undivided attention on the business
in which he is engaged.</p>

<p>If such qualities of the mind are called
forth and strengthened in the pursuit of a
harmless and delightful recreation, the time
cannot have been wholly wasted, although the
professed object of study may have been only
the art of giving <span class="smcap">CHECK-MATE</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> the person to whose care a young dog
is intrusted for education be furnished with
an instrument like a short trumpet, which
produces a few harsh and discordant notes;
and whenever it may be necessary to correct
the dog, in order to enforce obedience, let such
correction be accompanied by the noise of this
instrument rather than by "the thundering
voice and threatening mien" usually employed
on such occasions. When the dog's education
has been properly completed under this
system, although you may be comparatively a
stranger to him on first taking him into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
field, you will find that by carrying with you
a duplicate of the <i>un</i>musical instrument you
will have his master's voice in your pocket,
and you will be able at once to make a very
commanding impression upon him, by sounding
a few of the harsh and discordant tones
which he has been taught to fear and obey.</p>


<div class='center'><br />II.</div>

<p>You must not insist upon its being admitted
without dispute, that the man who
made <i>your</i> gun is the best maker in London.
This town is a very large place, and it contains
a great many gunmakers. You must
also remember that it "stands within the prospect
of belief" that there may be other
persons who think themselves as competent
to select a good gun, and to shoot well with
it afterwards as you are.</p>


<div class='center'><br />III.</div>

<p>In like manner, although you may prefer
using one kind of wadding to another, or may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
perhaps like to wear shoes and gaiters rather
than trousers and laced boots, you must not
suppose that every man who takes the liberty
of forming a different opinion from yours on
these subjects is a mere bungler.</p>


<div class='center'><br />IV.</div>

<p>However steady your pointer may be,
remember that he is but a dog. If you
encourage him to run after one hare because
it has been wounded by yourself, you must
not be angry with him for chasing another
which may be shot at by your friend. Canine
flesh and blood cannot bear this.</p>


<div class='center'><br />V.</div>

<p>Although you may be a very agreeable
gentleman, generally speaking, you will
choose an unlucky moment for making yourself
particularly so, if you should on some
fine morning after breakfast volunteer to
accompany two of your friends who are preparing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to leave the house for a day's partridge-shooting
without any expectation of
being joined by a third person.</p>


<div class='center'><br />VI.</div>

<p>When you are obliged to walk on the left-hand
side of a man who carries the muzzle
of his gun too low, do not be so very polite as
to take no notice of this dangerous habit.
He will, perhaps, appear quite offended
when you venture to question your perfect
safety. But be that as it may, your position
was so awfully unpleasant whilst you were
constantly stared at by the eyes of a double-barrelled
gun that your friend's looking rather
cross at you is a matter of much less consequence.</p>


<div class='center'><br />VII.</div>

<p>When a long search amongst high turnips
has been made, at your particular request,
for a bird which you erroneously suppose that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
you have brought down, and which (naturally
enough under such circumstances) cannot be
found, you must not say that your friend's
retriever has a very bad nose, or fancy that
"poor old Trigger, if he had been still alive,
could have easily found the bird."</p>


<div class='center'><br />VIII.</div>

<p>Should a farmer's boy come running to you
with a partridge which he has lately picked
up after seeing it fall in the next field, your
companion in arms will perhaps assure you
that this bird can be no other than that which
<i>he</i> shot at, as you may remember, immediately
after you had both of you passed through
the last hedge, and which he afterwards saw
flying very low, and very badly wounded,
exactly in the direction which the boy has
come from. An <i>enfant trouv&eacute;</i> like this seldom
waits long for a father to adopt it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />IX.</div>

<p>Sometimes towards the end of a fatiguing
day, when you feel like an overloaded gun-brig,
labouring against a heavy sea of turnips,
you may perchance espy a large covey of partridges
in the act of settling near a hedge a
long way before you. Supposing in such
case that your brother sportsman should be
a much younger man than yourself, and yet
should not have also seen these birds, it is
not always quite prudent that you should announce
the fact to him immediately. If you
wish to have a shot at them, you would, perhaps,
do well to say nothing about them till
your weary limbs have borne you unhurried
a little nearer to the hedge in question. The
good old rule of <i>seniores priores</i> is sometimes
reversed in a large turnip-field.</p>


<div class='center'><br />X.</div>

<p>In the case of a double shot a gamekeeper
never hesitates an instant in deciding whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the bird was killed by his master's gun or by
another person's, fired at the same moment.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XI.</div>

<p>When you are making your way through a
thick wood with too large a party, it is better
that you should be scolded by some of your
friends because you trouble them with very
frequent notice of your individual locality,
than that you should be shot by any of them
because you do not.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XII.</div>

<p>On the day of a great battue, if one of the
party (not you) should shoot much better
than the others, and if this should by
chance be talked of after dinner (as such
matters sometimes are), do not say much
about the very large number of hares and
pheasants killed by you&mdash;on some other
occasion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XIII.</div>

<p>When you are shooting in a wood, if
some hungry fox, in pursuit of his prey,
should chance to cross your path, it depends
entirely upon the "custom of the country"
whether you ought to kill him or not. Bob
Short says, in his Rules for Whist, "When
in doubt, win the trick."</p>


<div class='center'><br />XIV.</div>

<p>Never ask beforehand whether or not you
are to shoot hares in the cover into which you
are going, but never shoot one after you
have been told not to do so.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XV.</div>

<p>A singular species of optical delusion
often takes place in the case of a man
shooting at a woodcock in a thick cover.
According to the impression said to be made
upon the shooter's eye, the bird appears to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
fall dead more frequently than he can afterwards
be found&mdash;so that the truth of this
appearance must never be relied on when
the evidence of the bird himself cannot be
brought forward to support it.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XVI.</div>

<p>On a grand occasion you need not always
trouble yourself to keep an account of the
number of head killed by you, particularly if
you do not dine with the party on that day;
because, in your absence, the total number
brought home may perhaps be accounted for
after dinner, without any reference being
made to the amount of your<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> performances.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>XVII.</p>

<p>When you sit down (<i>horresco referens</i>) in
a dentist's chair,<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> in order to have your teeth
cleaned, and point out to him, with fear and
trembling, one of them which you think must
be drawn;&mdash;if he should tell you that the
tooth can be easily stopped, and may still be
of much service to you, do not immediately
thereupon feel quite bold and very comfortable.
After a moment's further inspection
he may, perhaps, add very quietly, in a kind
of whispering soliloquy, "Here are two
others which must be removed."</p>


<div class='center'><br />XVIII.</div>

<p>If you should stop, with a tired horse, at
the door of the "King's Head" anywhere,
and should say to the bowing landlord
thereof, that, unless you can find some other
means of pursuing your journey, you shall be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
obliged to have a chaise immediately, you
must not expect to be told by him that a very
good coach, which is going your way, will
change horses at the "Red Lion," nearly
opposite, in less than ten minutes. Should
this be the real state of the case, he will feel
that he has no time to lose; and therefore,
instantly seizing the handle of the hostler's
bell, and ringing a louder peal than usual, he
will at once show you into a back parlour, for
fear that you should see the coach before a
chaise can be got ready for you.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XIX.</div>

<p>Should it have been your fate to travel often,
<i>more majorum</i>, on the box of a stage-coach,
more than one coachman has probably told
you a story, two miles long, about some mare
so vicious and unmanageable that she had
been rejected by every other coachman on the
road, and that nobody but himself had ever
been able to drive her, saying at the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
time, "She is now, as you see, Sir, as quiet
as a lamb." You must not believe all this,
although it may perhaps be very true that the
mare kicks sometimes, and that the man is
not a bad coachman.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XX.</div>

<p>Although our friend the coachman is supposed
to have been so very communicative to
you on the last occasion, he may not perhaps be
equally so on all others: for instance, if, when
the roads are very bad, and the coach is heavily
laden, he should, near the end of a difficult
stage, pull up at some turnpike, and enter
into a long talk apparently about a bad shilling
or a lost parcel, he is very likely not to
explain to you and the other passengers that
his real reason for thus stopping is because
his horses are so much distressed that they
would otherwise be scarcely able to reach the
end of their ground. The conference at the
gate is held in order to facilitate the ratification<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of the treaty for fresh horses to be exchanged
in the next town.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXI.</div>

<p>On arriving at the place where "the coach
dines," walk to the nearest baker's shop, and
there satisfy your hunger in a wholesome
manner. At the dinner which is prepared
for the passengers it frequently happens that
if there should have been any cock-fighting
in the town lately,<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> the winner and the loser
of the last battle appear at the top of the
table as a couple of boiled fowls; and whenever
there is a roast goose at the bottom, it is
probably some old gander, who, after having
lived for many years in the parish, is at last
become so poor that he is obliged to be
"taken into the house."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'><br />XXII.</div>

<p>If you have children, who are clever, do
not question them too closely in company.
Supposing, for example, that at the close of
a social meal in the country, you should be
sitting at table with your guests, on the eve
of their departure from your hospitable roof:
if, under these circumstances, some nice little
fellow, who has lately rushed into the room,
and is now busily employed with a bunch of
grapes, should be called upon by you to join
in the general expression of regret that your
friends are to leave you to-morrow, he may
perhaps say, "Yes, papa, we shall have no
grapes after dinner to-morrow."</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXIII.</div>

<p>If you are thought to excel in any particular
game or sport, do not too often lead
to it as a subject of conversation: your superiority,
if real, will be duly felt by all your
acquaintance, and acknowledged by some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
them; and you may be sure that "a word"
in your favour from another person will add
more to your reputation than "a whole history"
from yourself.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXIV.</div>

<p>On seeing a new invention for the first
time, do not instantly suggest a material
alteration of it, as if you felt quite sure that
this sudden thought of yours must be a very
clever one. It may be reasonably supposed
that the inventor did not hastily build up his
work in its present form; and it would, therefore,
be very unkind that you should bring
the whole broadside of your intellectual guns
to bear upon it in a moment. Besides, after
all, it is just possible that the thing may be
better as it is&mdash;without your improvement.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXV.</div>

<p>The great merit of an important discovery
frequently consists in the first application of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
some well-known principle of action to a class
of objects to which it had not before been
applied. When such discovery has been
brought before the public in one instance,
the application of the same principle to other
nearly similar objects requires a much lower
degree of inventive talent. A sub-inventor of
this sort often views the result of his labour
with all the pride of a mother, when he is
only entitled to the praise due to an accoucheur.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXVI.</div>

<p>When your friends congratulate you on
your recovery from the effects of a serious
accident, it is very proper that you should
thank them sincerely for their kindness in so
doing: but it is by no means necessary that
you should give a very detailed description of
all your sufferings, and of every symptom
attending the gradual progress of your recovery;
nor need you explain exactly what was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
at first said by Mr. Drugger, the apothecary,
and what was afterwards the opinion of Sir
Astley Cooper. You had better not do this;
although some persons think that what the
nurse occasionally said ought not, in a case
like theirs, to be omitted.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXVII.</div>

<p>On the same principle, if you should have
lately been robbed, and should feel disposed to
communicate the particulars of this sad affair,
you really must not begin your account of it
by telling us every thing which you were
dreaming about just before you first heard
the noise of thieves in your house on the
eventful night of the robbery, adding always
in conclusion, by way of appendix to your
copious narrative, a correct list of the articles
stolen. If you do this too often, you must
not be surprised if some of your hearers
should at last be almost tempted to regret
that when you were robbed you were not
murdered also.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XXVIII.</div>

<p>If it should be mentioned in conversation
that a celebrated mare, belonging to Mr.
Swindle, of Newmarket, has lately trotted
sixteen miles within the hour, in harness, do
not think it necessary to recount the wonderful
performances of a famous gig-horse which
you once had.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXIX.</div>

<p>After having lost several games at billiards,
when you are playing at a gentleman's house,
it is not polite that you should attribute your
failure to the inaccuracies of the table.
These sundry defects of level are less likely
to be complained of by the winner than by
you; and he, therefore, stands less in need of
this caution than you do.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXX.</div>

<p>When the lord of the manor is showing
the beauties of his house and grounds to you,
and points out a very fine row of trees for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
your particular admiration, make no allusion
to the magnificence of the avenue at Wimpole;
and if he should afterwards show to
you one of his pictures, which he values
highly as the work of some celebrated master,
remember that, although you may have been
told privately, by a good authority, that the
picture is not really what your friend supposes
it to be, you are not called upon to display
your borrowed knowledge as your own,
and to make yourself odious by endeavouring
to convince him that he has been deceived in
the purchase.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXI.</div>

<p>Do not bestow extravagant praise upon
every article lately bought by you, as if you
considered that it had acquired increased
value from having fallen into the hands of so
distinguished a purchaser. Other persons
will estimate the worth of it rather by its own
merits than by yours.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXII.</div>

<p>It is quite unnecessary that you should
always, in order to show the extent of your
reading, claim a previous acquaintance with
every expression which may be referred to in
conversation as having been used by some
celebrated author in one of his works. It is
much easier for another person to quote lines
which never were written than it would be
for you to find them.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXIII.</div>

<p>Do not consider it to be at all times your
bounden duty to correct every mistake which
may be made in your presence as to a name
or an unimportant date. Some persons are
so extremely sensitive on these points that
they never allow the offender to escape a
summary conviction. However interesting
the conversation may be, they always feel justified
in interrupting it if they can show that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the anecdote which they have cut short related
to the late General A., and not to his
brother the admiral.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXIV.</div>

<p>If one of your party should be prevailed
upon to sing a comic song for the amusement
of the company, he will of course do it as
well as he can, and it would not be flattering
to him that you should immediately afterwards
talk about the great pleasure which
you formerly derived from hearing the same
song sung by Mathews, or Bannister.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXV.</div>

<p>Beware of the amiable weakness of repeatedly
telling long stories about your late
father or uncle. They may have been excellent
persons, and their memory may be
deservedly respected by you; but it does not
therefore necessarily follow that a full account
of everything which was said or done by either
of these worthy men on some trivial occasion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
should be very interesting to other people,
not even to such of your friends as may be
lucky enough not to have heard it before.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXVI.</div>

<p>If you should have lately suffered any great
reduction of income from causes over which
you had no control, it is better that you
should bear your misfortunes quietly than that
you should be very extensively communicative
to your acquaintance on the subject of your
grievances. If, for instance, you tell them
in confidence that you now have only 600<i>l.</i>
a-year to live upon, such of them as have but
500<i>l.</i> will perhaps think that you still have
at least 100<i>l.</i> more than you ought to have.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXVII.</div>

<p>Do not think yourself an accomplished
traveller merely because you have visited
places where you <i>might</i> have acquired much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
information. Many a man has passed some
time in a foreign town without learning more
about the beauties of its cathedral or the
manners and customs of its inhabitants than
was previously known to others through the
instructive medium of a book and pair of
spectacles at home; and therefore although
you may have really been at Rome, and may
have actually seen with your own eyes both
the Apollo Belvidere and Raphael's Transfiguration,
you must not, on that account only,
consider yourself qualified to take a leading
part in every conversation on subjects connected
with the fine arts.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXVIII.</div>

<p>Many persons who are possessed of much
information have a tedious and unconnected
way of imparting it. Such men are like
dictionaries, very instructive if opened in the
right place, but rather fatiguing to read
throughout.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />XXXIX.</div>

<p>The foundation of good breeding is the
absence of selfishness. By acting always on
this principle&mdash;by showing forbearance and
moderation in argument when you feel sure
that you are right, and a becoming diffidence
when you are in doubt, you will avoid many
of the errors which other men are apt to fall
into.</p>


<div class='center'><br />XL.</div>

<p>Artists, medical men, and engineers are
much to be feared by those persons who
are apt to talk a little sometimes on matters
which they do not very well understand. If,
reader, you are, like me, subject to this
infirmity, mind what you are about when any
professional men are present.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
